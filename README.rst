Getting started
---------------

- Download the latest version of the library from http://github/ajmazurie/xstats.mtesting/downloads
- Unzip the downloaded file, and go in the resulting directory
- Run ``python setup.py install``. Alternatively, you can package the library by typing ``python setup.py bdist``, which will result in the creation of a file dist/MultipleTesting-xxx.tar.gz, with 'xxx' being the version number and the name of your platform. Installing the library is thus as simple as ``easy_install dist/MultipleTesting-xxx.tar.gz``

From then you only have to import ``mtesting`` to use the library::

	import xstats.mtesting
